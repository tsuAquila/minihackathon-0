### Project Title:
ROCK , PAPER , SCISSORS


### Description:
A console-based "ROCK PAPER SCISSORS" game built in Python


### How we Built It:
This game is built entirely using Python. To enhance the user interface and experience, we've implemented several key features:

Console Management: Using the os and shutil modules, we've made sure the game visuals are consistent across various terminal sizes. The clear_terminal function refreshes the screen after each move, keeping the display clean.

Input & Visualization: With custom functions, we've achieved centered text in the console, giving the game a polished look.

User Experience Enhancements: The sleep module is employed to introduce short pauses before clearing the console

Game Logic: The computer's choices are randomized using the random module, ensuring each round is unpredictable.



### How to Use It:
Start the Game: Launch the Python script to begin.

Choose Rounds: You'll first be prompted to select how many rounds you'd like to play. Make sure to choose an odd number!

Make Your Move: For each round, you'll choose either ROCK, PAPER, or SCISSORS. Just type in your choice and hit enter.

Rock beats Scissors (Rock wins).
Scissors beat Paper (Scissors win).
Paper beats Rock (Paper wins). 

Await the Result: The computer will make its choice randomly. and the result for that round will be revealed.

Final Score: Once all rounds are played, the game will tally up the scores and announce the overall winner.

Feel free to restart the game as many times as you'd like. Challenge yourself to beat the computer!
Enjoy and may the best move win!
