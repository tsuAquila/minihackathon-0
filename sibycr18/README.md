### Project Title:
Cricket Trivia Game

### Description:
This is an interactive quiz game designed to test players' knowledge about cricket. The game presents players with a series of multiple-choice questions related to cricket, determining the player they get to bat with based on their trivia score. Additionally, the game simulates a cricket match where players can score runs by answering questions correctly and face different types of bowlers.

### How It Was Built:
The Cricket Trivia Game was developed using the Python programming language. The game utilizes the `random` library to generate random choices and select bowler types. The `inflect` library is used to handle ordinal numbers, and the `time` library adds delays for a more interactive experience.

### How to Use It:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter your name to start the game.
3. Answer 5 cricket trivia questions. Your trivia score determines your player and the number of wickets you have.
4. Play the match against different types of bowlers: fast, spin, and slow.
5. Score runs based on your correct answers.
6. Your total score will be displayed at the end of the game.
7. High scores are saved in the `cricket_scores.txt` file. You can view the top scores by running the program again.
